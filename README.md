# Push Swap

Push Swap is a project from the 42 coding schools

## Notes

You can read about the project in the **[subject](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/111156/en.subject.pdf)**.\
The project files are in the **/push_swap** directory.\
**ps_tester.sh** is a script that was made by [Han2-Ro](https://github.com/Han2-Ro), it lets you test your push_swap as many times as you want and spits out the average and highest operation counts, very helpful.\
**[Push Swap Visualizer](https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer)** turned out to be another invaluable tool during the project. With it, you get a visualization of both stacks, and you can see that your algorithm isn't doing what you thought it ought to be doing.
